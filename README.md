Sublime Text 2 Replacement Icons
==================

Do you love Sublime Text 2? Yeah, me too. I'm so-so on the icon though.

Since it's on my dock all day, I wanted something a little smoother. This is that smoothiness.

## To Install ##

OS X: 

1. Grab one of the `.icns` files from the `/icns` folder
2. Rename it `Sublime Text 2.icns`
3. Move it to `/Applications/Sublime Text 2/Contents/Resources/Sublime Text 2.icns`

Win / nix:

1. Grab the png from `/pngs` and _magic_ it into an icon (Anyone want to spell this out?)
